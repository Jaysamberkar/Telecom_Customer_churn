# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This project aims to analyze customer churn for a telecom company. Customer churn is a crucial business metric, especially for subscription-based industries like telecom, as it directly impacts revenue. Using machine learning techniques, this analysis helps identify factors that contribute to customer churn and predict which customers are at risk of leaving the service.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: The dataset contains information about telecom customers, including demographic details, services subscribed, and account information.
- **Objective**: The goal is to use data analysis and machine learning to understand customer churn and build a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning.
- **Techniques Used**: Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms.

## Files in the Repository
